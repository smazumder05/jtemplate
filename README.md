jtemplate
=========

A java project template used for all my java projects. Tt uses the following tools

  * Gradle 
  * [Pegdown doclet](https://github.com/Abnaxos/pegdown-doclet) for enhanced java documentation. You can now add Markdown tags to your java docs.
  * Standard logging libraries - SLF4J
  * The [Checker framework](http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/) comes pre-packaged with quite a few type systems, that verify nullability, tainting, regular expressions, physical units, immutability and more.
